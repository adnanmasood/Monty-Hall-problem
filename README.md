# Monty Hall Problem
## Multiple solutions & approaches

The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a television game show called "Let's Make a Deal," which was hosted by Monty Hall. The problem goes as follows:

1. You are a contestant on the show, and Monty presents you with three doors, labeled Door A, Door B, and Door C.
2. Behind one of the doors is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats (the consolation prize).
3. You choose one of the three doors, say Door A.
4. Monty, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors (say Door B) to reveal a goat. He then asks if you want to stick with your original choice (Door A) or switch to the remaining door (Door C).

The statistical dilemma associated with the Monty Hall problem lies in determining whether it's in your best interest to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining door.

Intuitively, many people believe that after Monty reveals the goat behind Door B, the probability of the car being behind Door A or Door C is 50/50. However, this is not the case. The correct strategy is to always switch doors.

Here's why:

When you initially choose a door, there is a 1/3 probability that it has the car behind it, and a 2/3 probability that one of the other two doors has the car. After Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, the probability distribution does not change. This means that the probability of the car being behind the remaining door is still 2/3, while the probability of it being behind your original choice is still 1/3. By switching doors, you effectively double your chances of winning the car.

The Monty Hall problem belongs to the general category of conditional probability problems, which involve determining the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In this case, the problem involves calculating the probability of winning the car given that Monty has already revealed a goat behind one of the other doors.

The Monty Hall problem is a classic example of how our intuition can often lead us astray when it comes to probability and statistics. It highlights the importance of using a systematic approach to problem-solving and understanding the underlying principles of conditional probability.


## Marilayn Vos Savant Explaination

Marilyn vos Savant is an American author and columnist known for her high IQ. In 1990, she addressed the Monty Hall problem in her "Ask Marilyn" column for Parade magazine. A reader asked her whether it was better to switch or stay with the original choice in the Monty Hall problem. Marilyn explained that the contestant should always switch doors, as the odds of winning would increase from 1/3 to 2/3.

Her explanation generated significant controversy, as many people, including some with backgrounds in mathematics and statistics, believed her answer was incorrect. They insisted that the probability of winning was 50/50, thinking that once Monty revealed a goat behind one door, there were only two doors left, making it an equal chance for the car to be behind either door.

However, Marilyn's explanation was correct, and those who tried to correct her were wrong. The mistake they made lies in not considering the fact that Monty's action of revealing a goat is not random but deliberate. Monty has the knowledge of what's behind each door and always opens a door with a goat behind it. This information alters the probability distribution of the remaining doors.

When the contestant initially chooses a door, there's a 1/3 chance of having the car behind it and a 2/3 chance of the car being behind one of the other two doors. After Monty reveals a goat, the probability doesn't become 1/2 for each remaining door. Instead, the probability of the car being behind the originally chosen door remains 1/3, while the probability of the car being behind the other unopened door becomes 2/3. This is because the 2/3 probability of the car being behind one of the other doors effectively transfers to the unopened door once Monty reveals a goat behind the other door.

Marilyn vos Savant's explanation of the Monty Hall problem highlights the importance of understanding conditional probability and showcases how intuition can sometimes lead us astray when it comes to complex probability problems.

#Different ways of solving the Problem.

The Monty Hall problem can be solved using programming through various approaches, such as simulation, enumeration, or direct probability calculation. Here, we'll discuss three different methods:

## Simulation:
This method involves simulating the Monty Hall problem multiple times and observing the outcomes. By running a large number of iterations, we can estimate the probabilities of winning by switching or staying with the original choice. In a programming language like Python, you could implement a simulation as follows:

```python
import random

def monty_hall_simulation(iterations, switch):
    wins = 0
    for _ in range(iterations):
        doors = [0, 0, 1]  # 0 represents a goat, 1 represents the car
        random.shuffle(doors)

        # Contestant chooses a door
        choice = random.choice(range(3))

        # Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors
        revealed_door = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and doors[i] == 0][0]

        # Switch or stay with the original choice
        if switch:
            final_choice = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and i != revealed_door][0]
        else:
            final_choice = choice

        # Check if the final choice is a win
        if doors[final_choice] == 1:
            wins += 1

    return wins / iterations

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_simulation(100000, True))
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_simulation(100000, False))
```

## Enumeration:
This method involves enumerating all possible scenarios and calculating the probabilities based on the outcomes. In this case, there are three possible initial choices, and Monty can open one of the two remaining doors. Using a programming language, you can calculate the probabilities by listing all the possibilities and counting the successful outcomes for switching and staying:

```python
def monty_hall_enumeration():
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    switch_wins = 0
    stay_wins = 0

    for choice in range(3):
        revealed_door = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and doors[i] == 0][0]
        if doors[choice] == 1:
            stay_wins += 1
        else:
            switch_wins += 1

    return switch_wins / 3, stay_wins / 3

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_enumeration()[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_enumeration()[1])
```

##  Direct probability calculation:
This method calculates the probabilities directly using conditional probability principles. Although this approach doesn't involve much programming, it can be implemented in a language like Python:

```python
def monty_hall_probabilities():
    prob_switch = 2/3
    prob_stay = 1/3
    return prob_switch, prob_stay

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_probabilities()[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_probabilities()[1])
```

In each of these methods, you'll observe that the probability of winning by switching is 2/3, while the probability of winning by staying with the original choice is 1/3, confirming Marilyn vos Savant's explanation.

In addition to the methods mentioned previously, here are two more ways to solve the Monty Hall problem using programming:

## Decision tree:

A decision tree is a tree-like structure that represents possible outcomes and decisions. You can create a decision tree to represent the Monty Hall problem and traverse it to find the probabilities of winning by switching or staying with the original choice.

```python
def monty_hall_decision_tree():
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    switch_wins = 0
    stay_wins = 0

    for choice in range(3):
        for monty_reveal in range(3):
            if monty_reveal == choice or doors[monty_reveal] == 1:
                continue

            if doors[choice] == 1:
                stay_wins += 1
            else:
                switch_wins += 1

    return switch_wins / 6, stay_wins / 6

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_decision_tree()[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_decision_tree()[1])
```

## Bayesian inference:

Bayesian inference is a method of updating probabilities based on new evidence. You can use it to solve the Monty Hall problem by updating the probabilities of the car being behind each door after Monty reveals a goat.

```python
def monty_hall_bayesian_inference():
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    prior_probabilities = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]

    for choice in range(3):
        revealed_door = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and doors[i] == 0][0]

        # Calculate the likelihoods of Monty's action given the car's location
        likelihoods = [0 if i == revealed_door else 1 for i in range(3)]

        # Update the probabilities using Bayes' theorem
        posterior_probabilities = [
            prior_probabilities[i] * likelihoods[i] for i in range(3)
        ]

        # Normalize the probabilities
        total_probability = sum(posterior_probabilities)
        posterior_probabilities = [
            prob / total_probability for prob in posterior_probabilities
        ]

        print(
            f"Probabilities after Monty reveals door {revealed_door + 1}: {posterior_probabilities}"
        )

monty_hall_bayesian_inference()
```

The Bayesian inference method demonstrates that the probability of the car being behind the originally chosen door remains 1/3, while the probability of the car being behind the remaining door increases to 2/3, confirming the previous findings.

These programming methods offer a variety of ways to analyze and solve the Monty Hall problem, each showcasing different aspects of probability theory and computational thinking.



## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling:

MCMC is a method for sampling from complex probability distributions, often used in Bayesian statistics. While the Monty Hall problem is relatively simple and doesn't require such an advanced technique, it can be solved using MCMC sampling as a demonstration.

Here's an example using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a popular MCMC method:

```python
import random
import numpy as np

def monty_hall_mcmc(iterations, burn_in=1000):
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    switch_wins = 0
    stay_wins = 0

    current_state = random.choice(range(3))

    for i in range(iterations):
        proposed_state = random.choice(range(3))

        if proposed_state != current_state:
            acceptance_ratio = 1
        else:
            acceptance_ratio = 0

        if random.random() < acceptance_ratio:
            current_state = proposed_state

        if i >= burn_in:
            if doors[current_state] == 1:
                stay_wins += 1
            else:
                switch_wins += 1

    return switch_wins / (iterations - burn_in), stay_wins / (iterations - burn_in)

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_mcmc(100000)[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_mcmc(100000)[1])
```

##  Recursive function:

The Monty Hall problem can also be solved using a recursive function. Although the problem itself is not inherently recursive, you can use recursion to explore the different scenarios of the game.

```python
def monty_hall_recursive(switch, choice=0, monty_reveal=0, depth=0):
    if depth == 2:
        if choice == monty_reveal or monty_reveal == 2:
            return 0
        return 1 if switch != choice else 0

    total_wins = 0
    for i in range(3):
        total_wins += monty_hall_recursive(switch, choice if depth != 0 else i, monty_reveal if depth != 1 else i, depth + 1)

    return total_wins / 3 if depth == 0 else total_wins

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_recursive(2))
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_recursive(0))
```


## Using Matrix Algebra:

Matrix algebra can be used to model the Monty Hall problem, representing the different states and transitions. While this approach is not as straightforward as other methods, it offers an opportunity to explore linear algebra in the context of the problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def monty_hall_matrix():
    # Transition matrix for initial door choice
    P_choice = np.array([
        [1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
        [1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
        [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]
    ])

    # Transition matrix for Monty's reveal
    P_reveal = np.array([
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])

    # Transition matrix for switching doors
    P_switch = np.array([
        [0, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 0]
    ])

    # Transition matrix for staying with original choice
    P_stay = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])

    # Combine the transition matrices
    P_switch_combined = P_choice @ P_reveal @ P_switch
    P_stay_combined = P_choice @ P_reveal @ P_stay

    # Calculate the probabilities of winning by switching or staying
    prob_switch = sum(P_switch_combined[:, 2])
    prob_stay = sum(P_stay_combined[:, 2])

    return prob_switch, prob_stay

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_matrix()[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_matrix()[1])
```

## Dynamic Programming:

Dynamic programming can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. Although the Monty Hall problem is not a typical candidate for dynamic programming, we can model it as a three-stage decision process and use dynamic programming to find the optimal strategy.

```python
def monty_hall_dynamic_programming():
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    switch_wins = 0
    stay_wins = 0

    for choice in range(3):
        # Stage 1: Contestant chooses a door
        value_choice = doors[choice]

        # Stage 2: Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors
        revealed_door = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and doors[i] == 0][0]
        value_reveal = doors[revealed_door]

        # Stage 3: Contestant decides to switch or stay with the original choice
        value_switch = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and i != revealed_door][0]

        if value_choice == 1:
            stay_wins += 1
        else:
            switch_wins += 1

    return switch_wins / 3, stay_wins / 3

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_dynamic_programming()[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_dynamic_programming()[1])
```

## Reinforcement Learning:

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Although the Monty Hall problem is not a typical candidate for reinforcement learning, we can model it as a two-stage decision process and use RL to find the optimal strategy.

```python
import random

def monty_hall_environment(choice, switch):
    doors = [0, 0, 1]
    random.shuffle(doors)
    
    # Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors
    revealed_door = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and doors[i] == 0][0]

    if switch:
        final_choice = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and i != revealed_door][0]
    else:
        final_choice = choice

    return 1 if doors[final_choice] == 1 else -1

def monty_hall_reinforcement_learning(iterations, alpha=0.1, epsilon=0.1):
    Q = [[0, 0] for _ in range(3)]

    for _ in range(iterations):
        choice = random.choice(range(3))
        action = 0 if random.random() < epsilon else np.argmax(Q[choice])

        reward = monty_hall_environment(choice, bool(action))
        Q[choice][action] += alpha * (reward - Q[choice][action])

    switch_wins = sum(Q[i][1] for i in range(3))
    stay_wins = sum(Q[i][0] for i in range(3))
    
    return switch_wins / (switch_wins + stay_wins), stay_wins / (switch_wins + stay_wins)

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_reinforcement_learning(100000)[0])
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_reinforcement_learning(100000)[1])

```

## Functional Programming:

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. We can use functional programming principles to solve the Monty Hall problem.

```python
import random
from functools import reduce

def monty_hall_functional(iterations, switch_strategy):
    doors = [0, 0, 1]

    def simulate_game(_):
        random.shuffle(doors)
        contestant_choice = random.choice(range(3))
        revealed_door = next(i for i in range(3) if i != contestant_choice and doors[i] == 0)
        final_choice = (contestant_choice if not switch_strategy else
                        next(i for i in range(3) if i != contestant_choice and i != revealed_door))
        return doors[final_choice]

    wins = sum(map(simulate_game, range(iterations)))
    return wins / iterations

print("Probability of winning by switching:", monty_hall_functional(100000, True))
print("Probability of winning by staying with the original choice:", monty_hall_functional(100000, False))
```

## Quantum Computing 
While quantum computing has the potential to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers, the Monty Hall problem with millions of doors does not benefit significantly from a quantum computing approach. Moreover, Q# is a domain-specific language for quantum computing, and it is designed to work with quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and quantum phase estimation.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability problem and can be solved efficiently using classical computing methods, even for a large number of doors. The generalization of the Monty Hall problem to millions of doors can be done by updating the simulation or analytical methods to account for the larger number of doors.

However, if you still want to try solving the Monty Hall problem with Q#, you can use Q# to create a quantum random number generator for selecting doors, and then use a classical algorithm to simulate the rest of the problem. This approach does not offer any significant benefits in terms of computation speed or efficiency, but it can serve as an interesting exercise in combining classical and quantum computing.

Here's a simple example of a quantum random number generator using Q#:

```qsharp
namespace QuantumMontyHall {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Convert;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation GenerateRandomNumber(max: Int) : Int {
        use qubit = Qubit[BitSizeI(max)];
        ApplyToEachA(H, qubit);
        let result = ResultArrayAsInt(MultiM(qubit));
        return result % max;
    }
}
```

In this example, `GenerateRandomNumber` is a Q# operation that generates a random integer between 0 and `max - 1`. You can then call this operation from a Python host program and use the random numbers to simulate the Monty Hall problem with millions of doors.

Keep in mind that this approach does not leverage the full power of quantum computing, and the Monty Hall problem does not require quantum computing to be solved efficiently, even for a large number of doors.


## Machine Learning

Applying machine learning to the Monty Hall problem can provide valuable insights into decision-making processes and reinforce the optimal strategy. One approach is to use reinforcement learning, specifically the multi-armed bandit algorithm, to simulate the problem and learn the best action given the current state.

In the Monty Hall problem, there are three actions: initially selecting a door, switching after a door is revealed, and staying with the initial choice. The multi-armed bandit algorithm can be employed to explore and exploit the best action based on the cumulative reward received over time. By simulating the Monty Hall problem thousands of times, the algorithm can effectively learn that switching doors after a non-winning door is revealed leads to a higher probability of success.

Through this process, the machine learning model demonstrates the counterintuitive nature of the Monty Hall problem and the optimal strategy, which is to switch doors after a non-winning door is revealed by the host. Applying machine learning to the problem not only confirms the optimal strategy but also serves as an educational tool for understanding complex decision-making scenarios.

In this example, we'll use a simple Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the optimal strategy for the Monty Hall problem. While this is not an advanced machine learning technique, it effectively illustrates the best approach to the problem.

```python
import random

def monty_hall_simulation(switch_doors, num_simulations=1000):
    winning_count = 0

    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        # Randomly place the prize behind one of the doors
        prize_door = random.randint(1, 3)

        # Randomly select a door
        selected_door = random.randint(1, 3)

        # Reveal a non-selected door that doesn't have the prize
        available_doors = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != selected_door and door != prize_door]
        revealed_door = random.choice(available_doors)

        # Switch doors if the strategy is to switch
        if switch_doors:
            remaining_door = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != selected_door and door != revealed_door][0]
            selected_door = remaining_door

        # Check if the selected door has the prize
        if selected_door == prize_door:
            winning_count += 1

    return winning_count / num_simulations

# Run the simulation for both strategies (switching and not switching)
switching_win_rate = monty_hall_simulation(switch_doors=True)
staying_win_rate = monty_hall_simulation(switch_doors=False)

print("Win rate when switching doors:", switching_win_rate)
print("Win rate when staying with the initial choice:", staying_win_rate)
```

This code defines a `monty_hall_simulation` function that simulates the Monty Hall problem with the option to switch doors or stay with the initial choice. The function runs the specified number of simulations (default is 1000) and returns the winning rate.

The function first randomly places the prize behind one of the doors and randomly selects a door. Then, it reveals a non-selected door without the prize. If the `switch_doors` parameter is set to `True`, the function switches to the remaining unopened door. Finally, the function checks if the selected door has the prize and updates the winning count accordingly.

After defining the function, we run the simulation for both strategies (switching and not switching) and print the winning rates. The simulation results will show that the win rate is significantly higher when switching doors, confirming the optimal strategy for the Monty Hall problem.
